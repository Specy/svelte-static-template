# Svelte template
This is the template i use for creating svelte websites.
It pre renders every route to it's initial state and builds the app into static files. 

# How to run
Simply run `npm run dev` or use your favourite package manager to run the command `dev`

# How to build
Run the command `build`, the pages will be generated in the build folder, and then you can locally
test the built version by running the `preview` command
